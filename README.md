# Advanced R Reading Group at Pacific Biology Station

A group of us are working our way through Hadley Wickham's 'Advanced R' book: <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/> I've read bits and pieces of it and have found it immensely helpful to have a deeper understanding of the language.

We plan to meet every 2–3 weeks. Contact Sean `sean.anderson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca` if you want to be added to the email list. We may adjust the schedule based on how the initial meetings go. 

Everyone is welcome but the topics covered are fairly advanced and we plan to work through it rapidly. This won't be a course, there will be little if any teaching, and the main impetus is to force those of us who are interested to thoroughly read the book and do the exercises. The meetings will be to discuss material and exercises that we struggled with.

If there are topics or exercises in the material covered that you particularly struggled, with please [post an issue](https://github.com/pbs-assess/adv-r-pbs/issues) in this repository (or email Sean) and if multiple people are struggling with the same concepts we can plan to focus on those at our next meeting.
